# OpenGL Light Simulation

##### Project done in Computer Graphics, at KMU, South Korea

### The Project
##### It's developed in C++ with OpenGL

##### It's a basic Raytracer handling light made with C++ language and OpenGL.
##### You can see here: lights (spot, diffuse, ambiant...), various object (plane, cube, sphere, dragon...), various materials...
##### The code is pretty well optimized, the light can move, object also with slight changes in the code.
